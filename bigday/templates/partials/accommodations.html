                Below is a brief list of recommendations on places to stay in Niagara-on-the-Lake.
            </p>
            <h3>Hilton Garden Inn</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/ontario/hilton-garden-inn-niagara-on-the-lake-XLVNLGI/index.html">Hilton Garden Inn</a> is conveniently located just off the highway and very close to the wedding venue.
                It is about a 20 minute drive to downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake.
                We have a block of discounted rooms reserved.
                Use the code <code>LZW16</code> to get the group discount.
            </p>
            <h3>White Oaks Resort</h3>
            <p>
                The White Oaks is very close to - and similar to - the Hilton Garden Inn.
                We were unable to get a group rate so just make a normal booking through <a href="http://www.whiteoaksresort.com/index.html">their website</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Vacation rentals</h3>
            <p>
                Both <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a> have a number of vacation rentals in the area.
                This is a highly recommended, and often more affordable option.

            <h3>Bed and Breakfasts</h3>
