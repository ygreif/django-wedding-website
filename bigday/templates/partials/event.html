            <h3>Getting There and Away</h3>
            <p>
                Niagara-on-the-Lake is located about 30 minutes NW of Niagara Falls, near the border between the US and Canada. <br/>
				
				For those coming from Canada, it is a 1.5 hour drive South from Toronto's Pearson International Airport and a 1 hour drive East from Hamilton's John C. Munro International Airport. <br/>
				
				Those coming from the US might find it cheaper to drive to Buffalo or fly to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The domestic flights to Buffalo are typically more cost-effective than flying internationally to Toronto. However, be sure to bring your passports and factor in additional travel time for the border crossing. There is a <a href="http://www.buffaloairportshuttle.com/">Buffalo Airport Shuttle</a> which offers transfers from the airport to Niagara-on-the-Lake. <br/>
				
				For those of you driving, we will try to facilitating carpooling with other guests. <br/>
				
				Bus service is also available to Niagara-on-the-Lake, though is not frequent and does require connecting through Niagara Falls. <br/>
