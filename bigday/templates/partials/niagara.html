            <h3>Getting There and Away</h3>
            <p>Saratoga Springs is about a 25 minute drive from Palo Alto, outside of (you guessed it) Saratoga. Note cell phone reception in the area can be spotty</p>
            <p>
	      The closest airport is San Jose.  But SFO is reasonably close by as well.
            </p>
            <p>For those of you driving, we will try to facilitate carpooling with other guests.</p>

            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p> We are working on this!
            </p>
            <p>We will provide one shuttle from Hilton Garden Inn and a second shuttle from the town of Niagara-on-the-Lake to the venue.
